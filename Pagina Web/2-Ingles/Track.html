                                    <p>The route, spanning approximately 20 kilometers with an accumulated altitude difference 
                                        of 912 meters, presents a medium to high level of difficulty, contingent upon the day's 
                                        weather conditions and the amount of snow accumulation. Depending on your physical 
                                        condition and rest intervals, the total duration averages around 8 hours, so an early 
                                        start is necessary if you wish to avoid finishing the hike in the dark.
                                        It's important to note that the final stretch to reach the car park is in rather poor 
                                        condition, with sharp bends, loose gravel, and numerous potholes, thus requiring extreme 
                                        caution. While accessible by any vehicle, it's advisable to use one with moderate ground clearance.                               
                                        From the moment you take the first step, you'll be captivated by the route. 
                                        It's not every day that you're rewarded with such expansive and close-up panoramic views 
                                        of giants like the Mulhacén, the Veleta, or Los Machos...</p>

                                <div class="first-img">

                                    <p>After reaching the summit of Papeles peak, standing at 2,424 meters, we encounter the first snowfields. It's been almost an hour and a half since we set out, and the trail 
                                        presents us with a spot to frolic in the snow, particularly enjoyable for the youngest members of the family.
                                        We press on without losing momentum until we ascend to the Loma de los Cuartos and then descend into the cirque 
                                        of Lavaderos de la Reina. This stretch is notably perilous, hence it's crucial to tread carefully and consider 
                                        using crampons for better traction on the terrain.
                                        We've arrived at the unequivocal highlight of the route: a wilderness imbued with a hint of mystery that evokes 
                                        both awe and trepidation in equal measure, captivating all who venture there.</p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="second-img">
                                    <img src="../0-img/LVR-8.jpeg" alt="Foto paisaje" width="500px">
                                </div>
                                <div class="third-p">
                                    <p>The next landmark along the route is the Covatillas waterfalls, a uniquely beautiful stretch offering vistas of 
                                        the cascading thaw water from the snow descending forcefully down the mountain. As we proceed into the final stretch, 
                                        we traverse the Papeles irrigation channel and the Hoya de la Alberca, where greenery takes center stage amidst springtime. 
                                        The most majestic landscapes now lie behind us. It's time to trek to the end of the route through less challenging and more uniform terrain, allowing us to fully absorb the uniqueness of the experience we've just lived.
                                        The optimal time to visit the Lavaderos de la Reina is during the thawing season, as this is when the streams 
                                        carry the highest volume of water, and interesting snow tunnels form over them and the irrigation ditches. 
                                        These phenomena typically last a few weeks or even a month, depending on the weather. 
                                        Some of these tunnels are sizable enough to walk through, but caution is necessary to avoid slipping, given the cold water flowing within them. 
                                        It's also unwise to cross over them, as they may break if the ice isn't sufficiently hardened.</p>
